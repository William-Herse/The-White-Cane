# Apologies

none

# Meeting Purpose

- further work conducted on the gyro and lidar to ensure functions are working as intended

# Previous Actions

- the gyro function found problems in reading its own movement when it adjusted causing a feedback loop which affected its ability to stabilise
- further tweaks were made to the function in order to get it to respond to outside movement only
- the lidar was further tweaked to ensure its stability at longer ranges and fix the overflow issue

# Regular Items

- progress continues as integration as, with gyro and lidar almost complete the project itself nears completion

# New Items

- the use of the current angle and the angle being changed to, in order to counteract the gyro reading the devices own movement and attempting to adjust it

# AOB

- none

# Next Meetings

- Next Sunday on the 30th
