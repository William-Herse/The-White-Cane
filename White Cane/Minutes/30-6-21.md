William, Locke, Harry

# Apologies

none

# Meeting Purpose

- the lidar was finalised, giving the desired results
- the accelerometer was implemented providing a more accurate and quicker stabilisation method than the gyro
- the final parts of integration were completed

# Previous Actions

- the lidar was modified in order to provide a clearer result, due to the error with the overflow the issue of longer distances still occurred

# Regular Items

- final parts of integration were completed as the project was finalised, performs as desired

# New Items

- the lidar was fixed by use of a pre scaler, allowing the timer to efficiently measure the small distances in front of the user without overflowing and causing errors
- the accelerometer function was implemented, being used to stabilise the device it proved much more efficient and responsive than the gyro and thus replaced it
- in order to find the angle required to be changed to, the angle between the current acceleration vector and the desired vector was calculated
